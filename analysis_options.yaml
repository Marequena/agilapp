# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# Use a small, local set of lints to avoid depending on an external package
# include that may not be available in this environment. Projects can opt
# to restore `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml` if present in the SDK or
# local packages.

    # is available in your environment.
